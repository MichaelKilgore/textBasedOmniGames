For instructions on how to play this game read the instructions.pdf.
## Inspiration
In the game DOTA 2 there is this thing called custom games. Custom games are games created by the community. Omni Parties was one of the more popular custom games. I took all the minigames in Omni parties that I felt could be played on the command prompt and created this application.
## Technical Highlights
Networking is written entirely by myself, no high-level libraries for client-server communications were used. The Pthreads library is used for multithreaded programming.
## Languages
The code is written entirely in C++, except for a bash script that creates the executables.
